# RpiAuth

A gem to handle authenticating via Hydra for Raspberry Pi Foundation Rails applications.

## Usage

How to use my plugin.

The Engine includes the [Rails CSRF protection gem](https://github.com/cookpad/omniauth-rails_csrf_protection), so this does not need to be included in the parent application

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rpi_auth'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install rpi_auth
```
